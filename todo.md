# Vegeta — TODO

Vegeta is the R&D notebook set: fast and dirty, and it stays that way (the blessed imperfection rule, README).
Rules: the tools stay independent packages; the stable physics of standard parts comes from Ogma (`libs/ogma/`,
`import ogma as og`); Piccolo never imports Vegeta, and a machine graduates there once its design is frozen.
Check quickly with `./test.sh --smoke` and the mocked tests (`VEGETA_DEBUG=1`, `-p vegeta.mock.pytest_plugin`);
the full suites are in `user_tests.sh`. Anything the refactor finds missing in Ogma is added to Ogma on the way. Earlier stages (1–13, 5b–5t, R, S) and their open items: [`old_todo.md`](old_todo.md).

Legend: `[ ]` open · `[x]` done · `[-]` deferred

## Stage V1 — The split with Piccolo (2026-10-20)
- [x] V1.1 Smoke suite `./test.sh --smoke` (under 30 s) and the pre-move baseline (`docs/migration/baseline.md`, robotics goldens recorded before the move)
- [x] V1.2 Yax design interchange (STL + `yax.json`) and `vegeta.dedalus.export_yax` (exact OCC mass properties, checked against the mesh integration)
- [x] V1.3 Chiron to its own repo (`technolog-spectrumai/chiron`, history kept, `chiron.mock` split out of `vegeta.mock`); `vegeta.chiron` stays here until the last machine hatches
- [x] V1.4 (reverted 2026-10-21: the races came home — Piccolo is ROS-centric full simulation; `races/` flies `ogma.rotors` and `designs/data/`, its tests run in the smoke beside the rest) The racing quad hatched → Piccolo v2: `races/`, the autopilot scripts, the race notebooks, `side_labs/races`, the races book (history kept; path map in `MOVED.md`); `labs/aero/designs/drongo_controller.py` stays (Drongo has not hatched)
- [x] V1.5 Boundary test: nothing in Vegeta imports Piccolo; engineering code imports no robotics (races included)
- [x] V1.6 README: the blessed imperfection rule — go fast and break things; Vegeta stays the R&D notebook set

## Stage V2 — Ogma vendored (Ogma O0–O2)
- [x] V2.1 `vendor/ogma` (squashed subtree, `scripts/update_ogma.sh`, `vendor/OGMA_REVISION`); Yax moved from Ozaru to Ogma
- [x] V2.2 `kestrel_systems.cg_inertia` and `nisus_systems.cg_inertia` as thin adapters over `og.mass.Budget` (goldens identical)
- [x] V2.3 `designs/gears.py`, `terramechanics.py` (→ `og.soil`), `tracks.py`, `cutting.py`, `actuators.py` moved to Ogma with history; designs import `og.*`, the old modules removed
- [x] V2.4 Ozaru's `mimesis` renamed `mimezia` (vendored Ozaru, imports, scripts, docs, `MIMEZIA_*` variables)

## Stage V3 — Designs on Ogma's physics (Ogma O3)
- [x] V3.1 `og.atmosphere`: `nisus_plus_systems` atmosphere and density altitude, `velutina_flight.isa_density`
- [x] V3.2 `og.wind`: `nisus_robot.Wind` (Nisus+'s `MountainWind` builds on it)
- [x] V3.3 `og.batteries`: `nisus_plus_systems` cells and packs, `nisus_systems` bought packs
- [x] V3.4 `og.rotors`: Drongo's `rotor_layout`, `Rotors` wrench and `Flight.mix`; `kestrel_flight.induced_velocity`
- [x] V3.5 `og.propulsion`: `nisus_systems.PropulsionMap`, `nisus_plus_systems.NisusPlusDrive` (`ElectricDrive`), `merlin_flight.Unit`, `kestrel_systems.DriveTable`
- [x] V3.6 `og.aero`: the Nisus and Nisus+ aero hooks (one stability model, crow optional; air angles and wrench), `kestrel_flight` `Polar`/`viterna_cd90`/`_cf`, `merlin_flight.Airframe`, `peregrine_flight.vlm`, the turbulent Cf copies (aguya, falco, merlin, nisus, peregrine, frame_study, air_propeller, merlin_flight)
- [x] V3.7 `og.motors`: `falco_systems._static_point` and the frame study's static loop (`operating_point`), the Nisus+/Falco resistance fits, the Onager Atlas tilt, Pekari roller and Perseus arm servos (`lever`)
- [x] V3.8 The `quat_to_R` / `euler_from_R` copies (`nisus_robot`, `drongo_controller`) → `og.frames` (the parked `exp/mini_races.py` keeps its own)
- [x] V3.9 The battery-for-CG solves of `kestrel_systems`, `kestrel_tandem`, `nisus_systems`, `nisus_plus_systems` (and so Falco), `peregrine_flight` → `og.mass.place_mass_for_cg` / `cg_with` (added to Ogma for tables that keep their own sums; tables identical before and after); `onager_robot`, `robot_dog_robot` (robotics, they graduate later) and the parked `kestrel_xwing.py` (then in `exp/`) keep theirs
- [x] V3.10 Velutina's wind → `og.wind`: `Wind.steady` (`from_direction`, `linear_shear`), `SiteWind`'s profile (`power_law`), the gust and navigation-error steps (`ou_euler_step`) in `simulate` and `follow_path` — all added to Ogma for it; the tower shadow and wake stay here (site-specific); episodes identical before and after
- [x] V3.11 `G` / `RHO` unified on `og.units`: the design models (`merlin_flight`, `nisus_systems`, `nisus_structure`, `nisus_plus_systems`, `falco_flight`, `falco_structure`, `onager_sweeper_cfd`) 9.81 → 9.80665 (weights −0.034 %, its own commit); every local `RHO`/`RHO0` = 1.225 and `G` = 9.80665 an import (no change); `og.aero.Airframe.g` = standard gravity. The Chiron robots and controllers keep 9.81 (Chiron's MuJoCo gravity) until they graduate
- [x] V3.12 Falco's `fuselage:` shell row gets its ellipsoidal-shell inertia (`nisus_systems.cg_inertia` matches `pod:` and `fuselage:`): Falco Iyy +4.4 %, Izz +1.8 %, Ixx +0.1 % (mass and CG unchanged; Nisus and Nisus+ unchanged)
- [x] V3.13 Boreas's `Motor` / `Battery` are Ogma's (`og.motors.DCMotor`, `og.batteries.NominalPack` — added for it) under Boreas's names, and `boreas.microjet.isa` takes the ISA from `og.atmosphere` (Ogma is a vendored library like numpy, not a Vegeta tool, so tool independence holds); Boreas tests 56/56 before and after

## Stage V4 — Vegeta application (after Ogma O6)
- [x] V4.1 Designs take their mass budgets, parts, propulsion and aero from `og.*` throughout: a sweep after V3 moved the last duplicates — the torque constant (`og.motors.kt`: `falco_systems`, `frame_study`), hover momentum theory (`og.rotors.hover_induced_velocity` / `ideal_hover_power`: `kestrel_loop`, `kestrel_study`), Velutina's ISA constants (`og.atmosphere`). Left on purpose: the Chiron robots and controllers (their servos, `cg`, `Drive`, 9.81 gravity) until they graduate (V5), and the parked `designs/exp/`
- [x] V4.2 Ogma's CAD strategy (`og.cad`, Ogma O6) carries the CAD ↔ physics link: `vegeta.dedalus.export_yax` takes its exact mass properties and the Yax mass section from `og.cad` (moved there); the designs' own geometry stays CadQuery in Dedalus (machine geometry is not Ogma's)

## Stage V6 — Standard files between platforms (2026-10-21)
- [x] V6.1 Ogma comes home: the parts library moved from its own repo into `libs/ogma/` with its history (`import ogma as og` unchanged); `vendor/ogma` removed; smoke runs `libs/ogma/tests`
- [x] V6.2 Yax moved to its own repo (`technolog-spectrumai/yax`) and becomes the format converter (USD hub); vendored at `vendor/yax` (`scripts/update_yax.sh`)
- [x] V6.5 Chiron stays home: `vegeta.chiron` is the one Chiron (the robots are designed and tested here); the chiron repository is retired and Piccolo no longer vendors it — a graduated robot goes to Piccolo as MJCF written through Yax
- [x] V6.3 Vegeta exchanges designs with Piccolo only as standard files (URDF/SDF/USD/MJCF/STEP/JSBSim) written through Yax
  - [x] Yax 2 converts every format (vendor/yax); Piccolo reads its fixtures and Gazebo models as standard files
  - [x] the export path: `python designs/export.py <machine> --to out/<machine>.usda --also sdf [--lump]` — Chiron robot → `to_mjcf()` → Yax; 14 machines (`--list`); `designs/tests/test_export.py` in smoke
  - [x] part data in the USD as `data["ogma"]`: Drongo's rotors (position, spin, mass, disk inertia, kF = T_max/ω_max², kM, ω_max, τ up/down) for Gazebo's motor models; `--lump` = one rigid body minus the rotors
  - [x] Piccolo takes it: `vehicles/received/drongo.usda` → `drako_drongo` through `yax sync` (Piccolo P2.8b)
  - [ ] part data for the rovers and walkers (wheel radii, servo limits) when Piccolo maps one — a wheeled diff-drive rover for Iguana first

## Stage V7 — Labs on a common library layer (2026-10-21)
- [x] V7.1 The lab rules hold in place: `libs/labkit` (bootstrap, machine registry, control, movie, kinematics, parts); `vegeta.mock.on_install` (designs coarsen themselves); the export reads each lab's `designs/machines.py`; `tools/labs.py check` in smoke
- [x] V7.2 The libraries live in `libs/` (vegeta-cli, -core, -ai, -fidia, ogma, labkit)
- [x] V7.3 `labs/{aero,land,legged,marine,studio}` in lifecycle folders (`notebooks, designs, sims, campaigns, exp, common, tests`); `components/` folded into `designs/`; all lab tests pass on mocks
- [x] V7.4 `tools/lab.py` (test, run, new-exp, promote, demote, export, readme), generated lab READMEs (machines' stages); `user_tests.sh` mocks only, per lab
- [x] V7.5 The graph effects measured (`docs/anatomy`): 0 cross-lab imports, 0 libs → lab imports, modularity 0.419 → 0.455, each lab reached by itself only (entropy 0), the libraries by several (0.57–0.99)
- [x] V7.6 Notebooks start with `bootstrap.lab("<lab>", DEBUG)` (61 notebooks: the `sys.path.insert` cells and `mock.setup` replaced; every notebook's bootstrap and imports run on mocks)
- [x] V7.7 Each lab's `common/` holds what its studies repeated (measured: functions defined identically in 2+ notebooks): `aero_kit` (plain, lower_skins), `land_kit` (terrain rocks/drops, pin stresses), `legged_kit` (pin_stress) — 25 copies in 19 notebooks replaced by imports; helpers that read notebook globals stay. The tools' copied helpers (`result.py` ×9, `_process.py` ×3, `cache.py`, `_progress.py`, `_watermark.py`) stay copies — each tool is standalone by rule (`test_independence`) — and are kept identical: `tools/sync_copies.py`, `tests/smoke/test_tool_copies.py`
- [x] V7.8 Marine has tests (the boat, the submarine and their assemblies build), studio has tests (every notebook bootstraps and its imports run)

## Stage K4 — K4TQ tilt-wing medical transport (plan: `labs/aero/notebooks/k4_plan.md`, `k4_work.md`)
- [ ] K4.1 **Check the drag of the wing-turning mechanism.** Each wing root is a rotating joint (±90° tilt) next to a fixed fuselage, so it cannot be faired like a fixed wing root. Sources to quantify:
  - the gap between the rotating root rib and the fuselage side (leakage from the pressure to the suction side: lost root lift, more induced drag);
  - the 42 mm tilt cartridge and the fold-hinge lugs standing out of the fuselage line;
  - any servo or gear bulge;
  - the fairing step at intermediate tilt (transition) and at the cruise trim angles (±5°).

  Stage 1 assumes 4 × 4 cm² of drag area for all of it (`k4tq_sizing.ROOT_GAP_CDA`, ESTIMATE). Check it:
  - with a root-junction CFD case in Stage 3 (cruise at 0° and ±5° tilt, gap 1 / 2 / 4 mm);
  - against fixes: a seal (brush or elastomer lip), a root disc fairing that turns with the wing, the cartridge sunk inside the fuselage line.

  Feed the result back into the drag build-up and the range.

  Stage 2 (2026-10-21) moved the tilt drive (stub, bearings, servo, gears) inside the fuselage: only the 12 mm fold knuckle, the hinge and locking pins and
  the stub's passage through the skin remain in the flow. The CFD question narrows to that knuckle, its gap and the root plate at 0 / ±5° tilt.
- [x] K4.2 Stage 1: the transition corridor solved as one least-power balance per speed (tilt, rear differential tilt, thrust, split; SLSQP with continuation): trimmed everywhere; wing-borne from 21 m/s, the free span stalled 1–20 m/s (the CFD question, R10); `phase1.md` regenerated
- [x] K4.3 Fuselage length: config B at 1.2 m with 15x10 (disc gap 159 mm, front motor at 63 % in the hover, the best R3 margin) — approved 2026-10-21
- [x] K4.5 Stage 2: the CAD masses (+12 %) broke the Stage 1 design (the mission −18 Wh, the sagged T/W 1.43): revised to MN501-S KV300, 16x10, 6S3P (`designs/data/k4tq/stage2_motor_sweep.csv`), Stage 1 rerun on the CAD masses (revision B)
- [ ] K4.6 Motor data to verify with T-Motor's datasheets before the BOM (Stage 4): the MN501-S KV300's no-load current (estimated 1.0 A) and its 40 A / 180 s rating at the hover's 6S current; the MN5006 / MN505-S rows likewise
- [x] K4.7 Wing sections by flight phase (NeuralFoil, `designs/k4tq_sections.py`, `exp/K4TQ_airfoils.ipynb`): front NACA 4415, rear NACA 2415 → K4TQ-F1 "Freddy" / F2; the four designs compared in `exp/K4TQ_compare.ipynb`
- [ ] K4.8 K4TQ-A1 / A2 (NACA 2412 front) leave 14.4 mm of section depth at the 120 mm front tip chord for a Ø16 spar that needs 18 mm: adopt K4TQ-F1's (Freddy's) sections, or taper the spar to Ø12 at the tip (Stage 4 structure decides)
- [ ] K4.9 Run the section CFD check (`exp/K4TQ_airfoils.ipynb`, DEBUG = False, ~30–45 min) — confirm NeuralFoil's ranking before freezing Freddy
- [x] K4.10 K4TQ-D1 "Dorothy" (branch `dev_kestrel4`): the powered in-flight fold; the smoke-zone study (`exp/K4TQ_dorothy.ipynb`): a 20–30° V-tuck cuts the gust bump to 75–88 % and keeps 65–83 % of the roll authority; > 35° the folded stall speed passes the propellers' speed; folding adds drag (no speed gain)
- [ ] K4.11 Dorothy's open items: the sagged-pack T/W 1.53 on 16x10 (< 1.6: 17x10 restores 1.78 at a 6 Wh R3 margin); D2 does not close the 1 kg mission; the fold-drive fairings' drag (4 × 6 cm² assumed: L/D 11.1 → 9.8) — the root-junction CFD (K4.1) decides; the smoke's heat on the motors, the ESCs and the Jetson's inlet
- [ ] K4.4 Smoke: the three race tests (`test_autopilot_telemetry_and_side_panel`, `test_neutral_scenario_is_the_nominal_lap`, `test_mujoco_second_with_tuned_autopilot`) fail in the combined `./test.sh --smoke` run with MuJoCo 3.16 installed but pass alone — an order/state dependence in the race suite, not K4TQ

## Stage V5 — Later: graduations to Piccolo
- [-] V5.1 Drongo
- [-] V5.2 Nisus / Nisus+ / Falco (+ `vegeta.mission` → Piccolo's `onboard`)
- [-] V5.3 The Onager series, Pekari, Perseus
- [-] V5.4 The robot dog and the Myropods (Chiron and MuJoCo leave Vegeta with them)
